### Hi there, I'm Mateusz ðŸ‘‹

#### I work as a programmer. 
In my job, I use mostly Microsoft programming stack (C#, sometimes unfortunately VB) + Angular. Privately I'm also a big fan of Python (for webdev especially Django!)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some small Angular applications utilizing primeNg (like todo apps, some weather sht etc)
**MY goal** of this is to sharpen my Angular skills

ðŸŒŸ One of my best private projects so far is Project Coconut - real-time, multiplayer, browser game in which your goal is to make as much money, as you can. **PASSIVELY** :) Trading stocks, real estates, commodities etc. etc. <br/>
**MY goal** in this project was to make as realistic stocks exchange model as possible. And to educate Poles more about finances and economy :)
