### Hi there, I'm Mateusz 👋

#### I work as a programmer. 
In my job, I usually use various programming languages, like Angular & NodeJS for one of my biggest commercial projects, Django or Python.
In my own private projects, at the moment, my first choose is Django.

🔭 I’m currently working on [Project Coconut](http://github.com/MateoSkyline/ProjectCoconut) - real-time, multiplayer, browser game in which your goal is to make as much money, as you can. **PASSIVELY** :) Trading stocks, real estates, commodities etc. etc. <br/>
**MY goal** in this project is to make as realistic stocks exchange model as possible. And to educate Poles more about finances and economy :)
